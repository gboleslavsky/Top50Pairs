/*
Artist_lists_small.txt contains the favorite musical artists of 1000 users. Each line is a list of up to 50 artists, formatted as follows:
Radiohead,Pulp,Morrissey,Delays,Stereophonics,Blur,Suede,Sleeper,The La's,Super Furry Animals,Iggy Pop\nâ€¨Band of Horses,Smashing Pumpkins,The Velvet Underground,Radiohead,The Decemberists,Morrissey,Television\n
etc.
The program below uses this file as input and produces an output file containing a list of pairs of artists which appear TOGETHER in at least fifty different lists. For example, in the above sample, Radiohead and
Morrissey appear together twice, but every other pair appears only once. The output file contains rows, each row being a pair. For example:
Morrissey,Radiohead\n
